Privacy Policy

Who we are

Currently, the microsite is administered by one person, that is, I: Yaroslav Solyanikov.
I invite other administrators of the site (as well as channels in Telegram, Yandex.Zen and Pikabu) to cooperate.

 Contacts:

The microsite usually contains links to social media posts and TXT files. There are no accounts on the site, and communication is conducted via email and messaging apps. Discussions are also held in the comments section of articles on Pikabu and Yandex.Zen (which can be accessed from the microsite http://tablepedia.com/deti ).

 User information is collected through viewing visit statistics. Additionally, anything you write in messaging apps or article comments may be shared with third parties. So it is not recommended for minors to enter any sites without the knowledge of parents.

 How long do we keep your data

If you leave a comment, the comment itself and its metadata are stored indefinitely. If you send an email, we store information related to your contact details.

Your contact information

Users' contact information is available within the comments written by the users themselves. Users decide which of their materials will be visible within the site or section, and they have the right to contact the site administration if they discover that their information has been deleted or modified without their knowledge, in order to restore it.
