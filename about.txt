About the site (The concept of a microsite with TXT files)
 I propose to discuss the concept of a microsite (for publicists, scientists, and entrepreneurs), where most of the information is presented in TXT files. The advantage of this format is that, for example, a publicist can create a TXT file expressing their opinion on recent events, and they can combine their file with others to provide arguments.

 For now, I propose the following content:

1. The microsite has a single page (the main page) in HTML format. It contains links to TXT files.

2. When updating the site, it is allowed to leave "old" TXT files, but they can only be accessed through the text files referenced by the main page.

3. The main page of the site resembles a blog, where each "post" has a date, title, and text. It may contain links to TXT and other files, as well as social media posts. 

4. The main page allows a minimum number of images (pictures).
